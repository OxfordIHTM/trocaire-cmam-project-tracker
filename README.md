This repository is for tracking progress of the Trōcaire Somalia Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme evaluation project.

## Approach

We utilise the [Github Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) and [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) functionalities that are designed for coding/software projects and extend it for general (not code only) projects.
This repository allows us to create "issues" which in our use case can be tasks or things to do that are not code- or software-related, assign them to a specific person in the team, and label it with appropriate work or task characteristic.

Alongside this repository, we also created a GitHub Project called [Trōcaire CMAM Project](https://github.com/orgs/OxfordIHTM/projects/75).
This provides a project board that shows the different issues/tasks organised into milestones view or status view.

With this, we can assign issues/tasks created in this repository to this specific project, and assign it to a specific milestone within this project.

## Usage/steps

There are two ways that issues/tasks can be created in this project:

*  Creating issues via the [project tracker repository](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/trocaire-cmam-project-tracker); or,

*  Creating issues via the [project dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/OxfordIHTM/projects/75).


### Creating issues via the project tracker repository

#### 1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/trocaire-cmam-project-tracker/issues) of the `OxfordIHTM/trocaire-cmam-project-tracker` repository.

![Step 1](images/issue_01.png)

By default, this page will load/show only issues that are still not completed or closed.
In the figure above, no issue/task has been created yet so nothing is listed.

#### 2. Click on the `New issue` button on the upper right of the page

![Step 2](images/issue_02.png)

#### 3. Write about the issue/task you are creating

![Step 3a](images/issue_03a.png)

You will see the figure above after clicking on `New issue` button.
Here, you will need to at least write a ***Title*** for the issue you are creating so that it can be recorded.
All other inputs and options can be filled later on.
After writing the title for the issue, you can click on `Create` button to create the issue.

![Step 3b](images/issue_03b.png)

You now have an issue/task created (see figure above).

#### 4. Add more information about the issue in the description box and in the various options in the right hand side of the description box. 

##### a. Add a description of the issue/task and additional notes

Click on vertical three dots on the upper right corner of the description box.

![Click on vertical three dots on the upper right corner of the description box.](images/issue_04a.png)

Write the description and any additional notes in the description box and then click on save.

##### b. Select an assignee

Click on the cog wheel icon on the Assignee option on the right hand side and select the person or persons to assign the issue/task to. You can assign it to yourself as well.

![Click on the cog wheel icon on the Assignee option on the right hand side and select the person or persons to assign the issue/task to. You can assign it to yourself as well.](images/issue_04c.png)

Type a name in the assignee search box if you can't find the person you want to assign the issue/task to. Only collaborators who are included in the repository itself will show up in the search.

##### c. Assign a label or labels

Click on the cog wheel icon on the Labels option on the right hand side and select all appropriate labels to assign the issue/task to.

##### d. Assign an issue/task type

Click on the cog wheel icon on the Type option on the right hand side and select all appropriate types to assign the issue/task to.

![Click on the cog wheel icon on the Type option on the right hand side and select all appropriate types to assign the issue/task to.](images/issue_04f.png)

##### e. Assign to a project or projects

Click on the cog wheel icon on the Projects option on the right hand side and select all appropriate projects to assign the issue/task to.

![Click on the cog wheel icon on the Projects option on the right hand side and select all appropriate projects to assign the issue/task to.](images/issue_04g.png)

##### f. Assign to a milestone

Click on the cog wheel icon on the Milestone option on the right hand side and select the milestone to assign the issue/task to.

![Click on the cog wheel icon on the Milestone option on the right hand side and select the milestone to assign the issue/task to.](images/issue_04h.png)

##### g. Set the status of the issue/task

In the Project option after you have assigned the issue/task to a project, assign a status to the issue/task.

##### h. Add comments or any additional notes about the task

In the comment box underneath the description, enter any additional comments about the issue/task or comment/respond to a previous comment or note then click on the Comment button below.

### Creating issue via the project dashboard

#### 1. Open the [project dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/OxfordIHTM/projects/75)

You will see a blank project dashboard when no issues/tasks have been created for the specific project/s tracked by the dashboard (see figure below).

![Project dashboard without any issues/tasks](images/issue_05a.png)

After an issue is created either through the [project tracker repository](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/trocaire-cmam-project-tracker) using the steps described earlier or through the [project dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/OxfordIHTM/projects/75) using the steps described below, then these issues/tasks will show up in the dashboard (see figure below).

![Project dashboard with the issue created earlier through the project tracker repository](images/issue_05b.png)

#### 2. Create a new issue

Click on the `+` symbol in the lower left part of the dashboard and select `Create new issue` (see figure below).

![Click on the + symbol in the lower left part of the dashboard and select Create new issue](images/issue_07.png)

#### 3. Provide details about the issue/task

A prompt box will show (see figure below) which would look like a small version of the issues creation page described earlier.

![A prompt box will show which would look like a small version of the issues creation page described earlier](images/issue_08a.png)

Fill in at minimum a title for the issue/task and then fill in all other information as with the earlier approach (see figure below).

![Fill in at minimum a title for the issue/task and then fill in all other information as with the earlier approach](images/issue_08b.png)

Click on the `Create` button to create the issue/task.

#### Fill in additional project tracking information

You will see the new issue in the project dashboard (see figure below).

![You will see the new issue in the project dashboard](images/issue_09a.png)

Start filling in other project tracking information as appropriate and required (see figure below).

![Start filling in other project tracking information as appropriate and required](images/issue_09b.png)

When you switch back to the project tracker repository issues page, you will now see the same issue you created in the project dashboard showing in the list of issues/tasks (see figure below).
